Hope everything goes well!\n","id":"https://thebokya.me/blog/first/","title":"First post man!"},"https://thebokya.me/blog/musing/":{"body":"Hello, let me formally introduce myself: I am Ayush, just one of the trillions of tiny organisms that inhabit this planet. It seemed like my life had no single direction and I'd move here and there (in my mind, obviously). So I decided to start journaling. They say it helps in organising your thoughts.\nI sometimes wonder (past 2 AM, a lot of times) what actually consciousness is. And why does our reality exist at all? What I want to say is: have you ever thought if absolutely nothing existed? AT. ALL?\nWhy is there a reason for the fabric of our reality to exist in the first place? Though whoever (or whatever) made this reality made the laws of Physics and Mathematics real fun. We gotta give them credit for that.\nWe never stop to appreciate how much of an amazing phenomenon life is! Just think of all the fundamental units of matter that had to come together and interact to form the most basic regenerating unit something not unlike (well, we are definitely made of more than two states and inhabit more than two dimensions as far as I know) the Glider in Conway's Game of Life. I mean, this is how we were actually made: a really huge (so huge you can't imagine, your brain will go into SegFault, I'm warning you!) number of such Gliders (made out of, I was bad at chemistry but I am 99% sure, Carbon compounds) and an array of their variations interplaying, dancing, fighting, perishing and, if fortunate, flourishing to whelp the first single-celled organism. All of this was extremely serendipitous (you can't even predict Conway's Game of Life, so stop predicting your own life!). If someone went roughly 4 billion years back in a time machine and gave the primordial soup a good stir (a single dip of the finger would also do), who knows what kind of abominations would be inhabiting this planet right at this moment? Anyways, fast-forward billions of years and you have us: a bunch of neurons coming together, sharing electric shocks, and wondering how they were made.\n\nOne more thing that fascinates me is how all of the mathematics in this world exists simultaneously as a set of unbreakable rules and as something completely abstract plucked out of the imagination of mathematicians.\nThe closest I can come to making sense of all of this is by thinking of mathematics as the language that the Universe speaks in. We humans, being the curious polyglots we are, interact with our surroundings and then learn the language they speak through close observation. For example, Egyptian geometry was literally created out of a necessity to keep track of the farm area when the Nile flooded them.\nSo these are some of my thoughts. Hope my brain likes all the journaling.\nEdit: I forgot to mention that Conway's Game of Life can be made using Conway's Game of Life, so there's a good chance that you live in a simulation. The vastness of it all is mind-boggling and humbling.\n","id":"https://thebokya.me/blog/musing/","title":"Musings"},"https://thebokya.me/blog/seeing-things/":{"body":"It is 2:00 AM as I write this, while laying in bed. I have come to the conclusion that I have looked at most of my life from inside myself.\nI think it is cumbersome for someone like me to explain, but most of my life, I have observed things like they were a TV show. I think that's unsurprising because I watched a lot of cartoon as a kid! I do not know for certain though.\nIn my younger years, I was quite perceptive of my environment. The smells, the visuals, the bursts of feelings, all were very well alive inside me. But with time I started living inside my head, only observing as a passing observer.\nIs it normal for feelings to dampen as we grow? I think many incidents in my lifetime too have shaped me. You won't know me completely until you have been me for all these years. Frankly, I myself have seen various 'me's playing their parts and leaving over the yeara.\nWhen it comes to other people, I fail to understand them many a times. I use the word 'understand' in the context of getting to know their self. Something like a signature of their person of sorts. Not thinking beyond things that were of immediate value to me must have played a good part, I guess.\nI also have been unforgivably pessimistic and anxious for the last few years. Though anxiety and pessimism have their own benefits, I have seldom known the benefits of being carefree.\nAmongst all this chaos inside, I let pass an unignorable amount of moments taking place in front of me. I think I never knew how to fully experience them. A lot of moments were comparable to a muted-sounding background orchestra in my dreams.\nI recently started devouring a book. I say devouring because I had read a large portion of it till now, but recently did I start hunting for the next sentence, famished. Knowing (or rather experiencing) another person through pages has opened my mind to dormant experiences.\nI have made a quite foolish decision to stay optimistic no matter what. My explanation is quite simple (and most probably flawed): there is no reason not to. Even if there were such a reason. I think I have overcomplicated most of my thought-process through analysis.\nI will try my best to truly feel the wet mud the next time I smell it.\nUntil we turn another page in life!\n","id":"https://thebokya.me/blog/seeing-things/","title":"Trying to See Things"},"https://thebokya.me/blog/sss/":{"body":"The title might sound like a spell straight out of Harry Potter ('Wingardium Leviosa!'), but trust me it is not!

However outlandish that statement may sound, it is, to an extent, true. Relax! It isn't the end of the world! The keys are signed every three months and will have very limited impact on the Internet if exposed at all.

So, my little hero, you are a scientist working at a top secret research facility and have stumbled upon a really dangerous secret — a number, which is the password to the head scientist's laptop.\nNow that you have this dangerous number, you, like a good member of the society, want to share this number amongst other four of your peers so that you can bully Mr. Boss into giving you a few extra holidays.\nNow, as a student of game theory, you know that your peers cannot be trusted and one (or more) of them could just go to the boss and snitch on you, putting all of you into a lot of trouble and earning the snitch a lot of blessings.\nTo preserve this number, you decide to use Shamir's method. You once read it in Adi Shamir's paper 'How to Share a Secret' and have been dying to implement it ever since.\nNow, you can share the secret amongst $5$ scientists and you won't be able to retrieve the number unless you have a number of scientists above a threshold consenting to unlock it. The secret number will be available only when atleast $3$ scientists put in their keys and rotate them.\nThis is called a threshold scheme.\nThe technique involves passing the number as a constant inside a polynomial with random coefficients. If you have forgotten, a polynomial is an equation with a bunch of $x$'s with increasing powers starting from one and attached to a number. Remember those quadratic equations with their elusive roots, those were polynomials! Polynomials are generally something like this:\n$f(x) = constant + ax + bx^2 + cx^3 ... wx^n$\nThey produce really awesome shapes depending on their coefficients and degree (the number of $x$'s in the equation). Some of the are:\n\n\nThey can even be straight lines, where the highest power of $x$ is 1\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" you might say, and storm away, feeling betrayed thinking that I just lured you into solving a bunch of maths while I promised you cryptography. Well, be patient.\nThe best thing is that polynomials aren't all about their looks! Adi Shamir found a really good use for them. See, the thing with polynomials is that (given enough of them) we can reverse-engineer/reconstruct them from the points that lie on them. Let's start with the most basic example: a line.\nYou have 2 points:\n\nYou can easily draw a line through them:\n\nAn important fact about this line is that it is distinct and no other lines can be produced from the given two points. Another fact is that if you have the line, you have the equation as well.\nThe same applies to polynomials of higher degrees. If you have $3$ points, you can draw a quadratic curve that passes through them. And those $3$ poins will always give you the same quadratic curve. In general, you can reconstruct an polynomial of $n$ degree if there are $n+1$ distinct points. Remember drawing curves for statistics in school when you would draw the points extra large so as to make the curves pass through them?\nOne more thing to note here is that you cannot reconstruct a distinct equation if you have less than $n+1$ points. You could draw all sorts of crazy shapes intersecting only two points, but none of them are distinct. You get an infinite number of quadratic equations passing through $2$ points, but there's only one quadratic equation passing through $3$ points.\nNow, the fun begins!\nThe Recipe\n\n\nThe first part of the process is\n\n\nHold the secret number firmly in your hand\n\n\nSneak it into the equation. You'll know exactly why we are putting this number where we are in the equation when we reconstruct the secret. We are gonna divide the secret amongst the scientists. We will use a quadratic equation so that the minimum points (and thus scientists) need to retrieve the equation are $3$ as quadratic equations are of the degree $2$ and thus atleast $2+1$ points are needed to reconstruct the equation. Write the following equation down:\n$y = secret + ax + bx^2$\nHere, $a$ and $b$ are completely random numbers. You will forget they ever existed after the first part of the process is done. Then you will have to reconstruct them in the second part. Randomness helps us in evading guesses.\n\n\nWe will assign $x$ as $1$ through $5$ for each scientist and enter the $x$ into the equation. Each scientist will get their own $y$ to make a sticker of and put on their laptop!\n\n\nThey have to preserve their pairs of $x$'s and $y$'s, called shares, if they ever want to retrieve the number.\n\n\nDone! That's all it takes to divide a secret! Now, unless atleast $3$ of the $5$ scientists are willing to retrieve the secret, say bye-bye to your vacations!\n\n\n\n\nYour boss is overworking your entire team and all of you agree that something needs to be done about it. You take the lead.\n\n\nGather $3$ or more scientists (the more the merrier).\n\n\nTake them to your ultra-safe safe where you kept the secret.\n\n\nList the things that you know:\n\nThe equation we used for the encryption was quadratic\nThe keys (the $x$'s and $y$'s) you gave the scientists can be used to reconstruct the equation\n\n\n\nNow, you have all the points, but you never gave a thought to the exact method of reconstructing the secret. You just intuitively knew what was gonna happen! Luckily, you have a scientist, who is a mathematician by night and who points you towards Lagrange's formula. Lagrange was this 18th century dude who made this incredible method that solves the exact problem we are facing. It takes in a bunch of points, and, for each point, it creates this monstrosity: $L_i(x) = \\frac{(x - x_0)(x - x_1) \\cdots (x - x_{i-1})(x - x_{i+1}) \\cdots (x - x_n)}{(x_i - x_0)(x_i - x_1) \\cdots (x_i - x_{i-1})(x_i - x_{i+1}) \\cdots (x_i - x_n)}$\n$L_i(x)$ is a term here for each of the points and $x_i$ is the point x-coordinate of the point we are using and all the other $x_{whatever}$ are the other points. We then multiply these $L_i(x)$'s with their respective $y_i$'s and add them up! This gives us a function $P(x)$.\n$P(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} y_i \\cdot L_i(x)$\nBelieve it or not, P(x) is our original function! The one we had to bid farewell to when we were done sharing our secrets. It's been so long!\n\n\nWe still don't know how to reconstruct the secret. Let's go back to the function's original form:\n$y = secret + ax + bx^2$\nThrough our rebellious shenanigans, we know that:\n$P(x) = secret + ax + bx^2$\nYou can now give any $x$ to $P(x)$ and it will bounce happily and give you some number. But, we are looking at a really specific (and special) $x$ here. Close your eyes and think (open them if you forget the equation). Think. Think. Think!\nYep! You bright little kiddo! The special $x$ is $0$, the secret ingredient of our secret recipe!\n$P(0) = secret + a\\cdot0+b\\cdot0^2$\nThus:\n$P(0) = secret$\n\n\n$LHS = RHS$\nYep! You got your secret back and are on your way to Lonavala!\n\n\n\n\nGetting Your Hands Dirty\nYou just beheld the miracles mathematics can do. If any of the concepts or mathematics bounced right over your head, you got me to blame.\nBy the way. here's some code for you to experiment with in the Common Tongue:\n\nTo share the secret and retrieve the shares:\n\nimport random\n\n# ax^2 + bx + secret = y\n\na, b = random.randint(-10000, 10000), random.randint(-10000, 10000)\n\nsecret = int(input(\"Enter secret: \"))\n\ndef get_y(x):\n    return a * x * x + b * x + secret\n\nfor i in range(1, 6):\n    print(f\"The five parts of the secret are {i}, {get_y(i)}\")\n\n\nTo reconstruct from the shares:\n\nfrom functools import reduce\n\n\ndef lagrange(x, xys):\n    common_numerator = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, [(x - xy[0]) for xy in xys], 1)\n    out = 0\n    for xy in xys:\n        print(out)\n        xn, yn = xy\n        current_term = 1\n        current_numerator = common_numerator // (x - xn)\n        current_denominator = reduce(\n            lambda xi, yi: xi * yi,\n            [(xn - xy[0]) if xn != xy[0] else 1 for xy in xys],\n            1,\n        )\n        current_term = (current_numerator / current_denominator) * xy[1]\n        print(current_numerator, current_denominator)\n        out += current_term\n    return out\n\n\nxys = []\n\nfor i in range(5):\n    xi, yi = [int(i) for i in input(f\"Enter x{i+1} and y{i+1}: \").split()]\n    xys.append([xi, yi])\n\nprint(lagrange(0, xys))\n\nYou could increase the number of degrees of the equation (the threshold) or increase the participants or do all sorts of things.\nHappy hacking!\nConclusion\nYou just learned a neat little trick to divide a secret amongst a number of participants while unwillingly facing a little maths with it. Fun fact: the co-founder of PayPal, Max Levchin, implemented the scheme in the early days of the company to secure the password to the company's database, but it was later shelved when eBay acquired the company.\nReferences\n\n\nThe original paper by Shamir\n\n\nThe post that led me down this rabbit hole\n\n\n","id":"https://thebokya.me/blog/sss/","title":"Shamir's Secret Sharing"},"https://thebokya.me/fiction/":{"body":"","id":"https://thebokya.me/fiction/","title":"Reality is what keeps the mind sane, fiction is what punches that sanity in the guts."}},"docInfo":{"https://thebokya.me/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://thebokya.me/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://thebokya.me/blog/asimovs-laws/":{"body":60,"title":6},"https://thebokya.me/blog/first/":{"body":8,"title":3},"https://thebokya.me/blog/musing/":{"body":260,"title":1},"https://thebokya.me/blog/seeing-things/":{"body":200,"title":3},"https://thebokya.me/blog/sss/":{"body":908,"title":3},"https://thebokya.me/fiction/":{"body":0,"title":8}},"length":8},"lang":"English"};
