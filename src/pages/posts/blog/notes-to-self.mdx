description: "Things I think I should not forget"
---
These are just some things I think I should always remember, because I keep forgetting them. I imagine this will be a living document, where I keep on adding more stuff.

- Things that consume you, like rage, cravings, urges, obsession, grief and everything similar, are without fail and exception bad for you. Always remember to identify when you are being consumed and controlled (by the triggers inside you).
- Less is better than more. You as a human cannot do most stuff beyond a certain scale. There is elegance in less.
- Time is the most untameable entity ever. All you can do is keep your neck down in front of her and make the best of however much you have of her.
