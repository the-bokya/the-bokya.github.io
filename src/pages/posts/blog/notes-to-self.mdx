description: "Things I think I should not forget"
---
These are just some things I think I should always remember, because I keep forgetting them. I imagine this will be a living document, where I keep on adding more stuff.

- Things that consume you, like rage, cravings, urges, obsession, grief and everything similar, are without fail and exception bad for you. Always remember to identify when you are being consumed and controlled (by the triggers inside you).
- Less is better than more. You as a human cannot do most stuff beyond a certain scale. There is elegance in less.
- You have a finite amount of time, an expiry date. Make sure it is used well.
- Check twice. Helps a lot.
