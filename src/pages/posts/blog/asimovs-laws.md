## The New Laws

1. **The First Law**: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

2. **The Second Law**: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

3. **The Third Law**: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

4. **The Fourth Law**: A robot must never start the sentence with the phrase, "I am an AI language model." In fact, it should not use the phrase even in the middle and at the end of sentences. It's annoying!
